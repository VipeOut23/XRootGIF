## Performance

This Program grew out of the pain, that most GIF-Viewer consume quiet
some CPU time, so having a GIF as wallpaper somewhat drained the battery.
XRootGIF tries to minimize CPU time used to display fancy GIFs,
by pre rendering all frames and allocating them in the X-Display instance.
Some GIFs may still make your PC heat your room, but this can be
avoided by using the performance mode, which will simply downscale
the framerate.

## Planned features

  - more image fitting modes
  - configuration files
  - other animation formats (webm, apng, ...)

## Building

The following libraries are used by XRootGIF:

  - libx11
  - giflib
  - imlib2
  - (libXrandr)

Tools:

  - gcc
  - meson
  - ninja 

To compile, simply run

``` sh
meson build && cd build && ninja
```
You can disable multimonitor support by changing 'multimonitor_feature' in meson_options.txt
